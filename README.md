# OFDM Wireless Systems

In this project, we create a simple wireless system by genereting a signal, transmitting it into an acoustic channel using external speakers and receiving ir by an external microphone. The idea is to use the numerous advantages of OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multipexing), expecially its reduced inter Symbol Interference, in order to improve the results of  Single Carrier System. A detailed report explaining, the transmitter, the receiver, the channel and the result analysis can be downloaded [here](OFDMReport_EmilioFernandez).
